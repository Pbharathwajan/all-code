Instructions for ChemCalc.py:

Periodic Table:

To use the periodic table function in this program, click on the first button "Periodic Table". 
This opens a new window with the periodic table, with the elements color coded to their respective blocks.

Compounds:

The compounds window is used to find specific information on compounds, specifically 
Molecular mass, Ocurrences, Composition, Stoichiometry.

    Molecular mass:

    Input the compound you would like to find Molecular Mass for and click the Molecular Mass button. 
    A window will popup with the Molecular mass of the compound.

    Ocurrences:
    Input the compound you would like to find the Ocurrences for. Click on the Ocurrences button.
    The output will show you the Ocurrence of each element in the compound.

    Composition:
    Input the compound you would like to find the Composition for. Click on the Composition button.
    To get the value for each element click the "Ok" button once to initialize, and then click it once for 
    each element in the compound.

    Stoichiometry:
    Choose your unit of measurement, input the measurement and click Ok to find the Stoichiometry.

Reactions:
Add each compound/element of the reactants One by One and each element of the Product One by one. (Unbalanced!!)
When you finish, click the ok button to view the reaction.
To view the balanced reaction, click on the balance button.
To view the Limiting reagent, click on the Limiting reagent button.
Input the measurements for the reactant and product, and click Ok.


There maybe some unexpected errors with use of the code, in case of such events please restart the program again.
